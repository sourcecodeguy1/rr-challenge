<h1 style="text-align: center">Laravel Vue Js</h1>

- Used PHP and MySQL for back-end
- Used Vue Js for front-end
- Used Axios to make post request
- Made 2 components
- Created Controllers and Model
- Created migration for database stuff

I was working on this under XAMPP. This shouldn't be difficult to run and test.
Just make sure you create database then run migration.
